QUESTION 9]

Write a PL/SQL code block to calculate the area of a circle for a value of radius varying from 5 to 9. Store the radius and the corresponding values of calculated area in an empty table named areas, consisting of two columns, radius and area.

CODE :

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE CalculateCircleArea()
BEGIN
    DECLARE current_radius INT;
    DECLARE area DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS areas (
        radius INT,
        area DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
    
    SET current_radius = 5;

    WHILE current_radius <= 9 DO
        SET area = 3.14159265358979323846 * POW(current_radius, 2);

        INSERT INTO areas (radius, area) VALUES (current_radius, area);

        SET current_radius = current_radius + 1;
    END WHILE;
END //
select * from areas;
